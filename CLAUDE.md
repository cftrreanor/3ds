# Project notes
- Owner is non-technical: explain setup steps plainly, never ask them to paste secrets into chat.
- A migration that creates a table grants its access in the same file (`grant ... to service_role`,
  plus `authenticated`/`anon` as needed): Supabase no longer grants it automatically.
- Privacy rules live in the database (supabase/migrations). Any change to RLS or the
  security-definer functions needs a matching case in supabase/tests/security_test.sql.
- Run `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build && npm run test:db` before pushing.
- Product name comes from src/lib/brand.ts only; don't hard-code it.
- All website and in-app copy follows docs/brand-voice.md (tagline, no exclamation points, Oxford
  comma, no periods on incomplete headlines/buttons/bullets/labels, "organizer" for the role, claims guardrails). In-app permission levels stay "Host"/"Co-host"/"Account Host".
- Number-only fields use `NumberInput` (src/components/number-input.tsx): a type-in box that
  accepts digits only. Never use `<input type="number">` (no up/down arrows).
- Designs go through the design-review skill (.claude/skills/design-review): mock-ups before
  building, screenshots before a PR goes out. Severity 3–4 findings block until the owner decides,
  and decisions are logged in docs/design-decisions/.
- Before mocking up or building anything people see, read docs/design-lessons.md (what the review panel
  keeps finding). Run its self-check before every review, and add repeat findings to it afterward.
- When a page's main data is missing, call `missing()` from src/lib/schema-check.ts, not
  `notFound()`: it shows "a database update is needed" when a migration hasn't been run yet.
