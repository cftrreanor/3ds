Your front office checks every adult in at the door on any phone. Only your event team sees children's details, and they're deleted 30 days after the event.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do band and choir directors register for our contest or festival?",
    a: "Share one registration link. Directors fill in the form, with no account to set up first, and confirm with a code we email them. Returning directors reuse their saved details. They see their performance time or room schedule as soon as you publish it, and can withdraw from their own page if plans change.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do volunteers sign up and get checked in?",
    a: "Share a link or QR code. Volunteers pick a shift on their phone without making an account, and they get a confirmation and a calendar invite. They're checked in at the desk with one tap, and walk-ups can fill open spots on the day.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can it run a school fair or PTO fundraiser?",
    a: "Yes. Organize booths and community partners by zone, check partners in as they arrive, staff volunteer stations with Station Coordinators, and share a public page of everything at the event that thanks your partners.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do volunteers, parents, or visiting directors have to pay or download an app?",
    a: `No app, and no platform fee. Only the school or organization running the event pays to use ${brand.name}. Everyone they invite (volunteers, parents and families, and visiting band and choir directors) uses ${brand.name} at no charge, right in their phone's web browser. Any registration fee or ticket price the event itself charges is set by the organizer and is separate from ${brand.name}.`,
  },
  {
    q: "How is student and family information handled?",
    a: "Band contests collect headcounts, not student names. Children's names at school visitor events and conferences are deleted 30 days after the event, and volunteers' phone numbers 10 days after. Conference bookings are seen only by the teacher, and Section Leads see volunteers' phone numbers only on event day. No ads, no spam, and emails used only for your event. Our Student data privacy page has the full details.",

    q: "Who is it for?",
